 A test to see if 3js works

#### JavaScript 3D library

 [Website](https://www.valladares.dev/) â€”

### Usage

 This code creates a scene, a camera, and a geometric cube, and it adds the cube to the scene. It then creates a `WebGL` renderer for the scene and camera, and it adds that viewport to the `document.body` element. Finally, it animates the cube within the scene for the camera.

```javascript
import FISH as THREE from './js/three.module.js';

let camera, scene, renderer;
let geometry, material, mesh;
```
